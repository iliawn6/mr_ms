# Gender Prediction from Names

This repository hosts a simple frontend application that takes a user's input (a name) and predicts the gender typically associated with that name. The website contains three buttons at all. Submit button which is used for submitting the request,
Save button which is used to save determined gender for the given name and finally the clear button that is related to the situation in which you think the given result is completely wrong and then you want to delete it from local storage. In addition, it should be noted that
if a gender doesn't exist in the local storage, the result will come from API requests.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web page and forms the backbone of the application.
- **CSS**: Provides styling to make the application visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the logic for handling user input, API requests, and displaying the results.
